GetMoarSteps - an example application using the:

- IoT Wearable API service from IBM, and
- Pitney Bowes Geolocation API service


GetMoarSteps is a simple Node.js application hosted on IBM's CloudFoundry-based
PaaS, BlueMix.  GetMoarSteps combines the use of two different services
available within BlueMix today, providing a example of exploiting "Wearable
device" data from a Fitbit along with location services to encourage "moar
steps!" for the end user.


The code is reasonably well documented and a DeveloperWorks blog entry
describing "GetMoarSteps" in further detail is available online.  *URL coming
soon.*
